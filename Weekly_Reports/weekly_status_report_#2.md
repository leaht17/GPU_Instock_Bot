**GPU Instock Bot Weekly Summary #2**

**Team Report**

- **Last Week&#39;s Goals**
  - Finalize wireframe and start implementing front-end (research frameworks to use).
  - Create a diagram for how scraped data will flow into AWS and the user interface to understand the data cycle and user interaction (backend and frontend diagrams).
  - Thursday meeting we will discuss meeting times for the following Tuesday and other possible meeting times.
- **Progress and Issues**
  - Set up GitHub repo and start working on the README file.
  - Develop starter code for Django app structure with basic login form.
  - Agreed on new Tuesday meeting time: 12:30-2:30 pm.
  - Update living document (from requirements and policies assignment) based on the feedback we received on Canvas and from the project meeting.
  - Everyone is doing research on their areas of focus.
  - Creating a scraper for Best Buy API did not go as planned as it requires an API key that is no longer given out to free or .edu emails. (Alternatives or workarounds are needed for this)
- **Plans and Goals**
  - One newegg GPU scraper will be finished tonight by Derek. Another Best Buy scraper will be finished by David within the next couple days. This will allow Andy, Derek and David to start working on getting the scrapers onto AWS virtual servers by next Tuesday.
  - Liz, Milan and Leah will also meet to discuss the GUI for the website, and Liz and Milan will work on implementing a frontend with functional forms and buttons that are ready to start sending information to the backend AWS servers.

**Contributions**

- **Last Week&#39;s Goals**
  - Leah &amp; Derek develop front end wireframe (go over this as a group on Thursday in addition to solo development).
  - Derek will code the Newegg stock checker
  - Andy will develop the high level back-end architecture overview.
  - Milan &amp; Liz figure out Django and get a basic non-functional signup page.
  - David will code the Best Buy stock checker
- **Progress and Issues**
  - Leah is working on a draft of the frontend wireframe.
  - David is switching over to figuring out how to use the Best Buy API.
  - Derek will now focus on looking into scraping retailers for GPUs.
  - Andy is looking into structuring the backend architecture.
  - Milan and Liz are setting up Django. Currently working on a signup functionality.
- **Plans and Goals**
  - Leah will continue working on the frontend wireframe and share the design with Milan and Liz to start implementing the GUI.
  - Andy will finish and go over backend design Thursday. Setting up AWS instances as the design gets closer to being finalized.
  - Milan and Liz will continue working with the Django frontend, focusing on implementing user interface based on Leah&#39;s wireframe.
  - David will continue working on setting up the scraper for GPU&#39;s in Best Buy, finding alternatives to the current web request with API key method that does not work. Find ways to print out stock status for each GPU.
  - Derek is working on finishing the newegg scraper and will work together with Andy and David on getting the scrapers working on AWS Lambda virtual servers.
